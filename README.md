# UFOs
## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to build a webpage with a table that takes user inputs and displays the information requested. Users will be able to filter the UFO sightings table based on different criteria such as the event date, city, state, country and shape.

## Results

### Using the filters

When entering a date (1/1/2010) and a city (bonita) the results are narrowed to just one event. The user can also use other filters such as the shape of the sighting.

## Summary
### Drawback

The filters require correct lower case spellings. In the example above, if the user typed Bonita instead of bonita it would not recognize the city and no sightings would show up. Another drawback is that the user must already know the specific dates, cities or shapes in order to get a result.

### Recommendations

- The date filter should allow a date range rather than just a specific date. This way it would be easier for the user to spot research and spot UFO sighting trends.

- The city filter should have dropdown menu. It would be easier for the user to find a city this way rather than having to scroll through all the data.
